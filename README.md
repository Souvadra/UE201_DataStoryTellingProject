# UE201_DataStoryTellingProject

The code has been tested on MATLAB R2020b and R2019b. Some of the functions used might require 
a 2019b or later version of MATLAB to work properly, as per the MATLAB documentation page. To best 
of my knowledge, nothing but the basic MATLAB download is required to run this package as the 
whole code is built from scratch. 

The whole operation is divided into a number of functions each having their separate input and 
output parameters and a distinct operations. 

Each function has its working procedure briefly mentioned in the code files. Feel free to read that,
if in doubt. 

To run the model for the first time, without much hesitation, run the file 
"ImageClassificationMainInterface.m" and sit back and relax for a few minute when it trains the model
on the data and save the model in "DeployableModelWeights.mat" that can be used later for custom 
deployment.
